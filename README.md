A small plugin to add timers to the sliding blocks of the agility pyramid in OSRS.

## Contributing
I'm open to feedback on the code. I just really wanted a timer and whipped this up
over a few hours one weekend.

## FAQ
**Why isn't this part of the core Agility plugin?**
I originally submitted this as an update, however the team
was swamped at the time, I was training agility,
and I didn't want it to get lost in the sea of PRs so this
was broken out into its own plugin where code reviews aren't
mandatory for approval.
